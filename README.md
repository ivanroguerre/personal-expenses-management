## About This Project

This project (at least in its initial phase) was built with AI assistance using **Claude Opus 4.5**. The following prompt was used to architect and implement the core functionality:

> You're going to build a personal expenses management system. The system is going to be composed of 3 pages:
>
> - A dashboard with analytics of your expenses.
>
> - A expenses list (in a table) with sorting and filtering capabilities
>
> - A expenses form (used to add a expense or modify an existing one)
>
> The main objective is to allow for a user to add, visualize, edit and delete expenses.
>
>
>
> I need you to propose architectonic decisions for this app taking into account:
>
> - Nextjs + typescript are a must.
>
> - Shadcn + tailwind are a must.
>
> - The code must be clean and scalable
>
> - A state management library could be used
>
> - Proper error and loading handling must be provided

The AI-assisted development approach enabled rapid prototyping while maintaining best practices, clean architecture, and comprehensive type safety throughout the codebase.

### Iterative Development & Enhancements

After the initial MVP was delivered, the project underwent several iterations to improve user experience and functionality. This demonstrates that AI-assisted development isn't just about the initial build—it's also effective for iterative improvements and feature refinements.

These improvements showcase how the codebase's clean architecture and separation of concerns (data layer, hooks, components) made it easy to implement significant feature changes without requiring major refactoring. The type-safe TypeScript implementation and modular component design enabled confident modifications with minimal risk of introducing bugs.

#### Dashboard Recent Expenses Evolution

Another refinement focused on improving the date display format in the recent expenses widget:

**Initial State (MVP):**
- Date displayed in "MMM dd" format (e.g., "Nov 27")
- Ambiguous for expenses from previous years
- Limited temporal context for older records

**Iterative Improvements:**
1. **Enhanced Date Format** - Expanded date display to include year information
   - Changed from "MMM dd" to "MMM dd, yyyy" format (e.g., "Nov 27, 2025")
   - Provides complete temporal context at a glance
   - Particularly valuable when reviewing historical expenses
   - Maintains compact display while adding clarity

This seemingly small enhancement significantly improves data clarity, especially for users tracking expenses over multiple years. The change demonstrates how attention to UX details can make the application more intuitive and informative without adding complexity.

#### Dashboard Redirect Buttons Evolution

A key usability improvement focused on enhancing navigation from the dashboard to the expenses list:

**Initial State (MVP):**
- Single "Agregar Gasto" (Add Expense) button in dashboard header
- Required users to use sidebar navigation to access the expenses list
- No quick path from dashboard to full expenses view

**Iterative Improvements:**
1. **Added Expenses List Navigation** - Introduced a secondary button for direct access
   - New "Ver Gastos" (View Expenses) button with List icon from lucide-react
   - Links directly to `/expenses` page for instant access to the full expenses table
   - Improves discoverability of the expenses list feature

2. **Visual Hierarchy** - Implemented button variants to establish clear action priority
   - "Ver Gastos" uses `outline` variant for secondary action styling
   - "Agregar Gasto" maintains default/primary variant for emphasis
   - Clear visual distinction helps users understand the primary action (adding expenses) while providing easy access to viewing all expenses

3. **Improved User Flow** - Enhanced navigation patterns throughout the application
   - Users can now navigate directly from dashboard analytics to detailed expense list
   - Reduces clicks needed to move between dashboard overview and data management
   - Creates a more fluid user experience between viewing insights and managing data

The clean separation between presentation and logic allowed for straightforward internationalization without requiring architectural changes.

#### Expenses List Actions Language Evolution

A focused internationalization refinement that completed the Spanish localization of the expenses table by translating action menu elements:

**Initial State:**
- Actions dropdown menu displayed in English
- Screen reader text: "Open menu"
- Menu label: "Actions"
- Menu items: "Edit", "Delete"
- Inconsistent language experience within the expenses table
- Mixed Spanish/English interface reducing user experience quality

**Iterative Improvements:**
1. **Action Menu Translation** - Localized all interactive elements in the table's dropdown menu (`src/components/expenses/columns.tsx`)
   - Screen reader accessibility text changed from "Open menu" to "Abrir menú"
   - Dropdown menu label updated from "Actions" to "Acciones"
   - Edit action button translated to "Editar"
   - Delete action button translated to "Eliminar"
   - Maintained all existing functionality and event handlers

2. **Accessibility Preservation** - Ensured screen reader support remains complete in Spanish

The attention to detail in translating even accessibility text demonstrates a commitment to inclusive design, ensuring that assistive technology users also receive a properly localized experience.

#### Expenses List Date Range Evolution

A powerful filtering enhancement focused on enabling users to filter expenses by custom date ranges:

**Initial State (MVP):**
- Basic filtering limited to category and search text
- No temporal filtering capabilities
- Users could only see all expenses or filter by category
- Limited ability to analyze spending within specific time periods

**Iterative Improvements:**
1. **Date Range Picker Component** - Integrated a sophisticated calendar-based selection system
   - Added dual-month calendar view using `react-day-picker` for easy date range selection
   - Implemented popover trigger button showing selected date range or placeholder text
   - Calendar displays two months side-by-side for convenient range selection across month boundaries
   - Used `date-fns` for consistent date formatting (dd/MM/yyyy format)

2. **UI Store Integration** - Seamlessly connected with existing state management
   - Leveraged existing `startDate` and `endDate` fields already defined in `ExpenseFilters` type
   - Date range state managed through Zustand store alongside category and search filters
   - `setFilters` and `resetFilters` actions automatically handle date range updates
   - Clear filters button now includes date range in the reset operation

3. **Visual Integration** - Enhanced filter bar with cohesive design
   - Date picker button styled consistently with other filter controls
   - Dynamic button text shows selected range or prompts user to "Seleccionar fechas"
   - Calendar icon from lucide-react provides clear visual affordance
   - Responsive design maintains usability across different screen sizes

4. **Backend Compatibility** - Worked seamlessly with existing database layer
   - Database filtering logic (`getFilteredExpenses`) already supported date range filtering
   - Date comparison properly handles Date objects from the store
   - No modifications needed to data layer or API hooks
   - Filter changes trigger automatic query invalidation and refetch

This enhancement demonstrates the benefits of forward-thinking architecture. The `ExpenseFilters` type was designed with `startDate` and `endDate` fields from the beginning, and the database layer already implemented the filtering logic, making it trivial to add the UI component. The modular component design and separation of concerns allowed this significant feature addition with changes only to the filters component, showcasing how well-architected applications can evolve gracefully without requiring extensive refactoring.

#### Expenses List Date Range Language Evolution

A localization refinement focused on adapting the calendar date picker interface to properly display in Spanish:

**Initial State:**
- Date range picker displayed in default English locale
- Month names shown in English (January, February, etc.)
- Weekday abbreviations in English (Mo, Tu, We, etc.)
- Inconsistent with the rest of the Spanish-localized interface
- Generic date formatting without locale-specific conventions

**Iterative Improvements:**
1. **Spanish Locale Integration** - Added `date-fns` Spanish locale throughout the component
   - Imported `es` locale from `date-fns/locale`
   - Passed locale to the Calendar component via the `locale` prop
   - Updated all `format()` function calls to include `{ locale: es }` parameter
   - Calendar now displays in Spanish by default

2. **Custom Formatters for Proper Capitalization** - Implemented formatters to match Spanish conventions
   - Added `formatWeekdayName` formatter to capitalize weekday abbreviations (Lu, Ma, Mi, etc.)
   - Added `formatMonthCaption` formatter to capitalize month names (Enero 2025, Febrero 2025, etc.)
   - Spanish locale provides lowercase strings by default; formatters ensure proper title case
   - Maintains consistent capitalization with other UI elements throughout the application

3. **Date Display Consistency** - Ensured formatted dates match the calendar locale
   - Button trigger showing selected date range now uses Spanish locale
   - Date format (dd/MM/yyyy) remains the same but respects locale-specific rendering
   - Seamless integration between calendar selection and displayed date range
   - All date-related text now consistently in Spanish across the filtering interface

4. **React Day Picker Integration** - Leveraged built-in locale support from underlying library
   - `react-day-picker` natively supports `date-fns` locales
   - No modifications needed to the base Calendar component
   - Locale prop passed through component hierarchy cleanly
   - Maintains all existing calendar functionality while switching languages

This localization improvement completes the Spanish language experience for the expenses filtering system, ensuring that all user-facing elements—including the sophisticated date range picker—are consistently presented in Spanish. The use of custom formatters demonstrates attention to linguistic detail, as Spanish capitalization conventions differ from English in calendar contexts. This enhancement showcases how modern date libraries like `date-fns` and `react-day-picker` make internationalization straightforward when properly integrated.

#### Expenses List Column Order Evolution

A UX-focused refinement to optimize the table layout based on information hierarchy and scanning patterns:

**Initial State:**
- Column order: "Fecha" (Date), "Descripción" (Description), "Categoría" (Category), "Monto" (Amount)
- Date column positioned first as primary information
- Amount displayed last, requiring users to scan across the entire row
- Conventional chronological-first approach common in many data tables

**Iterative Improvements:**
1. **Reordered Column Layout** - Restructured table columns to prioritize key expense information
   - New order: "Descripción", "Monto", "Categoría", "Fecha"
   - Description moved to first position as the primary identifier for each expense
   - Amount positioned second for immediate visibility of spending values
   - Category placed third for quick visual categorization via color-coded badges
   - Date moved to fourth position, still accessible but no longer the primary focus

2. **Header Updates** - Applied consistent column order across all table states
   - Updated sortable table headers in the main view to match new order
   - Modified loading skeleton structure to reflect new column positions
   - Maintained SortButton functionality for all columns in their new positions
   - Preserved all existing sort capabilities without breaking functionality

3. **Data Row Consistency** - Ensured data cells aligned perfectly with new header structure
   - Updated TableCell rendering order to match header sequence
   - Maintained proper text alignment (amount stays right-aligned)
   - Preserved column-specific styling (e.g., category badges, date formatting)
   - Actions column remained in the rightmost position for consistent interaction patterns

4. **Improved Scanning Efficiency** - Enhanced user experience through better information hierarchy
   - Users can now quickly identify expenses by description without reading full rows
   - Amount visibility improved for rapid spending assessment
   - Visual category badges provide at-a-glance classification after amount
   - Date information available but doesn't dominate the visual hierarchy

This reordering demonstrates how small layout adjustments can significantly impact usability. By placing the most frequently referenced information (description and amount) at the beginning of each row, users can scan and process expense data more efficiently. The change prioritizes "what was spent and how much" over "when it was spent," which better aligns with typical expense review workflows where users want to quickly identify and verify spending amounts rather than focusing primarily on chronological order.

#### Expenses List Pagination Evolution

A scalability-focused enhancement to handle large datasets efficiently by implementing table pagination:

**Initial State:**
- All expenses displayed in a single, continuously scrolling table
- No limit on the number of rows shown simultaneously
- Performance concerns with large datasets (hundreds or thousands of expenses)
- Difficult to navigate and find specific expenses in long lists
- Overwhelming user experience when viewing extensive expense history

**Iterative Improvements:**
1. **Pagination State Management** - Integrated pagination controls into the existing UI store

   - Added `pageSize` state (default: 20) to control rows per page
   - Implemented `setPage()` and `setPageSize()` actions for navigation control
   - Added `resetPagination()` utility to restore default pagination state
   - Existing `setFilters()` and `setSort()` now automatically reset to page 1 to prevent empty page views

2. **Table Pagination Logic** - Enhanced table component with intelligent data slicing
   - Calculated pagination values: `totalItems`, `totalPages`, `startIndex`, `endIndex`
   - Implemented expense slicing to show only current page's subset of data
   - Added automatic page adjustment when total pages decrease (prevents showing empty pages)
   - Maintained all existing functionality (sorting, filtering, loading states) while paginating results
   - Zero performance impact on filtering or sorting operations

3. **Pagination Controls UI** - Designed intuitive navigation interface below the table
   - **Page size selector** - Dropdown with options: 10, 20, 50, 100 rows per page
   - **Navigation buttons** - Previous/Next page buttons with ChevronLeft/ChevronRight icons
   - **Information display** - Shows "X-Y de Z" format (e.g., "1-20 de 150 gastos")
   - **Smart disabled states** - Buttons disabled at first/last page to prevent invalid navigation
   - Consistent Spanish localization matching the rest of the expenses interface

4. **User Experience Optimization** - Thoughtful design decisions for better usability
   - Default 20 rows strikes balance between information density and performance
   - Page size selector positioned on the left for easy access
   - Navigation controls and info display aligned to the right for visual hierarchy
   - Responsive layout maintains usability across different screen sizes
   - Shadcn Select and Button components ensure design consistency with existing UI

This pagination implementation demonstrates the application's readiness to scale with growing datasets. Rather than implementing the full-featured Shadcn DataTable component, this lightweight custom solution leverages the existing table structure and adds only the essential pagination features needed. The clean integration with the UI store and automatic page reset behavior create an intuitive experience where users don't have to think about pagination edge cases—the system handles them automatically. This approach maintains code simplicity while solving the core scalability challenge of displaying large expense lists.

#### Expenses List Default Date Range Filter Evolution

A smart filtering enhancement focused on providing a more relevant default view by limiting expenses to the current year:

**Initial State:**
- Expenses list displayed all expenses regardless of date by default
- No temporal filtering applied on initial page load
- Users viewing expenses spanning multiple years would see everything mixed together
- Required manual date range selection to focus on specific time periods
- `defaultFilters` in UI store was an empty object with no date constraints

**Iterative Improvements:**
1. **Current Year Calculation Helper** - Added intelligent date range generation
   - Created `getCurrentYearDateRange()` function to compute year boundaries dynamically
   - Calculates start of year: January 1st at midnight (00:00:00)
   - Calculates end of year: December 31st at 23:59:59.999
   - Returns typed object with `startOfYear` and `endOfYear` Date objects
   - Executes once on module load for optimal performance

2. **Default Filter Enhancement** - Updated UI store to apply year filter automatically

   - Makes it immediately clear to users that temporal filtering is active
   - Provides intuitive starting point for adjusting date ranges
   - Users can easily clear or modify the date filter using existing controls

4. **Reset Behavior Consistency** - Maintained expected filter reset functionality
   - "Limpiar filtros" button now resets to current year (not all-time)
   - Consistent with the principle that default view shows current year
   - Prevents accidental exposure to multi-year historical data
   - Users must explicitly adjust date range to view previous years
   - Aligns with typical expense management workflows focused on current period

This enhancement demonstrates thoughtful UX design for temporal data. By defaulting to the current year, the application provides a more focused and relevant view for most users' primary use case—managing current expenses. The implementation is clean and efficient, calculating the date range once at module initialization rather than on every render. This approach respects the existing filter architecture while improving the out-of-box experience, especially valuable for users with extensive expense history spanning multiple years. The automatic year boundary detection ensures the filter stays relevant as time progresses, requiring no manual updates when the calendar year changes.

   - Component architecture and file organization unaffected
   - Zero breaking changes to component APIs or state management

This comprehensive localization completes the Spanish language transformation of the expense management workflow, covering both creation and editing interfaces. Users can now add, view, edit, and delete expenses entirely in Spanish, from page titles and form labels to validation messages and calendar interfaces. The systematic approach ensures linguistic consistency across all user touchpoints while maintaining code quality and architectural integrity. The integration of Spanish locale for date formatting demonstrates attention to cultural conventions, as date presentation differs between languages. This enhancement showcases the application's commitment to accessibility and user experience for Spanish-speaking audiences, providing a fully native language experience without compromising the technical foundation.

#### Add/Edit Expenses Field Order Evolution

A UX-focused refinement to optimize the form layout based on information hierarchy and natural data entry flow:

**Initial State:**
- Field order: "Monto" (Amount), "Descripción" (Description), "Categoría" (Category), "Fecha" (Date)
- Amount field positioned first as primary input
- Description placed second, requiring users to think about quantity before context
- Standard form order but not aligned with natural expense logging workflow

**Iterative Improvements:**
1. **Reordered Form Fields** - Restructured input sequence to match natural thought process
   - New order: "Descripción", "Monto", "Categoría", "Fecha"
   - Description moved to first position as the primary identifier for each expense
   - Amount positioned second after users have established what the expense was for
   - Category placed third for logical classification after description and amount
   - Date remains in fourth position, maintaining its role as temporal metadata

2. **Improved Data Entry Flow** - Enhanced user experience through better field progression

   - Reduces mental context switching during data entry
   - More intuitive tab order for keyboard navigation users

3. **Form Component Consistency** - Applied changes consistently across all form instances
   - Updated `expense-form.tsx` component to reflect new field order
   - Reordering affects both create new expense and edit expense flows
   - Maintained all existing validation logic and error handling
   - No changes to form submission or data processing logic
   - Preserved all field labels, placeholders, and help text

4. **Maintained Default Values** - Ensured proper pre-population for edit operations
   - Default values in form initialization remain correctly mapped to new field positions
   - Edit mode continues to populate all fields accurately from existing expense data
   - Visual field order change doesn't affect underlying data structure or storage
   - Form state management and react-hook-form integration unaffected

This reordering demonstrates how thoughtful form design can reduce cognitive friction during data entry. By placing the description field first, users can establish context before thinking about numerical values, creating a more natural narrative flow: "I spent money on [description] which cost [amount] in the [category] category on [date]." This seemingly minor adjustment aligns the form structure with how users mentally process and recall expenses, potentially reducing data entry errors and improving overall satisfaction with the expense logging experience.

This architecture follows Next.js 13+ conventions for:

- File-based routing with App Router
- Colocation of related components
- Clear separation of concerns (UI, logic, data)
- Server and Client Component separation
- Optimized rendering strategies

#### Data Model

```typescript
interface Expense {
  id: string;                    // UUID v4
  amount: number;                // Positive decimal
  description: string;           // User-provided description
  category: ExpenseCategory;     // Predefined category
  date: Date;                    // Expense date
  createdAt: Date;              // Record creation timestamp
  updatedAt: Date;              // Last modification timestamp
}

type ExpenseCategory = 
  | 'food' 
  | 'transport' 
  | 'entertainment' 
  | 'utilities' 
  | 'health' 
  | 'shopping' 
  | 'other';
```

### Key Architectural Decisions

#### 1. Offline-First with IndexedDB

**Decision:** Use IndexedDB via Dexie.js instead of a traditional backend database.

**Rationale:**
- No backend infrastructure or hosting costs required
- Instant read/write operations (no network latency)
- Works completely offline
- Sufficient storage for years of expense data
- Dexie.js provides type-safe, promise-based API
- Easy schema versioning for future migrations

#### 2. Separated State Management

**Decision:** Use Zustand for UI state and TanStack Query for server/async state.

**Rationale:**
- **Zustand** handles ephemeral UI state (sidebar open/closed, active filters, sort preferences)
  - Minimal boilerplate and small bundle size
  - Perfect for client-only state that doesn't need persistence
- **TanStack Query** manages expense data with:
  - Automatic caching to prevent redundant database reads
  - Background refetching to keep data fresh
  - Optimistic updates for instant UI feedback
  - Built-in loading and error states
  - Invalidation strategies for data consistency

This separation keeps concerns clean and leverages each tool's strengths.

#### 3. Form Handling Strategy

**Decision:** React Hook Form + Zod for all forms.

**Rationale:**
- **React Hook Form** uses uncontrolled inputs, reducing re-renders
- Shared form component works for both create and edit operations
- **Zod** provides runtime validation matching TypeScript types
- Single source of truth for validation rules
- Excellent error handling and user feedback
- Easy integration with Shadcn form components

#### 4. Component Organization

**Decision:** Feature-based component organization with shared UI library.

**Rationale:**
- `/components/ui` - Shadcn components (design system primitives)
- `/components/[feature]` - Feature-specific components (dashboard, expenses)
- `/components/layout` - Shared layout components (sidebar, header)
- `/components/shared` - Shared business components (error boundaries, skeletons)

This structure makes it easy to:
- Find components related to specific features
- Share common components without circular dependencies
- Scale the application as features grow

#### 5. Error & Loading Handling

**Decision:** Multi-layered error and loading state management.

**Implementation:**
- React Error Boundaries catch component-level errors
- TanStack Query provides `isLoading`, `isError`, `error` states per query
- Skeleton loaders for graceful loading states
- Toast notifications (Sonner) for user feedback on mutations
- Fallback UI for better user experience

#### 6. Routing Strategy

**Routes:**
- `/` - Dashboard with analytics and spending visualizations
- `/expenses` - Paginated expenses table with sorting and filtering
- `/expenses/new` - Create new expense form
- `/expenses/[id]` - Edit existing expense form

**Benefits:**
- Clear, RESTful URL structure
- Easy navigation and bookmarking
- Shared form component reduces code duplication
- Next.js App Router handles loading and error states per route

### Development Workflow

#### Local Development

```bash
npm run dev          # Start development server with hot reload
                     # Runs on http://localhost:3000
                     # Fast Refresh enabled for instant updates
```

#### Production Build

```bash
npm run build        # Create optimized production build
                     # Runs TypeScript compiler
                     # Generates static and dynamic routes
                     # Optimizes assets and bundles

npm start            # Serve production build locally
```

#### Code Quality

```bash
npm run lint         # Run ESLint to check code quality
                     # Identifies potential bugs and style issues
                     # Enforces Next.js best practices

npm run lint:fix     # Automatically fix linting issues
                     # Applies safe automatic fixes
                     # Manual review may be needed for complex issues
```

### Database Management

The application uses IndexedDB with the following characteristics:

- **Database Name:** `ExpensesDB`
- **Version:** 1
- **Schema:** Single `expenses` table with indexes on `date`, `category`, and `createdAt`
- **Storage Location:** Browser storage (persistent across sessions)
- **Data Persistence:** Automatic, no manual save required

#### Database Operations

All CRUD operations are handled through:
- `lib/db/expenses.ts` - Core database functions
- `hooks/use-expenses.ts` - Query hooks for fetching
- `hooks/use-expense-mutations.ts` - Mutation hooks for modifications

#### Clearing Data

To reset the database during development:
```javascript
// In browser console
indexedDB.deleteDatabase('ExpensesDB');
// Then refresh the page
```

## Browser Compatibility

This application requires a modern browser with support for:
- IndexedDB (all modern browsers)
- ES2020+ features
- CSS Grid and Flexbox
- Web Storage API

**Recommended browsers:**
- Chrome/Edge 90+
- Firefox 88+
- Safari 14+

## Future Enhancements

Potential features for future development:
- 📤 Export data to CSV/PDF
- 📅 Budget tracking and alerts
- 🔄 Data sync across devices (cloud backup)
- 🏷️ Custom categories and tags
- 📊 More advanced analytics and reports
- 🌙 Dark mode theme
- 🔍 Full-text search across descriptions
- 📎 Attachment support (receipts, invoices)
